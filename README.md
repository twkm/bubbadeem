# BUBBADEEM!

BUBBADEEM! is a simple HTML5 game I made to help my not-quite-two-year-old daughter learn how to use her computer. It's named after her pronunciation of "Bubble Game".

## STEM for Kids

STEM = Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math.

Part of the reason I built this was to gain an understanding of Canvas and JavaScript, but the bigger part was so that one day I could show my daughter how. I want to show her that she is able to build the things she imagines. I envision us playing and hacking away on this game when she gets a little older, teaching her valuable programming skills along the way.

I've released this game under the [Unlicense](http://unlicense.org/) so that you can do the same. Play it with your kids, hack it with your kids, use it in the classroom, use it to make a completely different game.

I'll be adding more comments and documentation over time to make it easier to understand, teach, and learn from.

Feel free to do whatever you want with it and make it better! I'd love to see what you come up with, tweet me [@twkm](https://twitter.com/twkm) to share what you've made with your kids!
